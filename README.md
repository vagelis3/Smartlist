Firmstep Developer Test

Fist i create an index.html file to make the stacture of my page. 
After i create a css file with the stylesheets (form-basic.css). I try to give the style as the example and i keep notes to every section.
The next step was to give function to form element. Pressing the button submit i call a file data.php. This api connects me to the database that i have already created local with xampp. After this i collect all the data and i importing them to database.
The final step was to export this data into table. I create table.php in order to collect the data and put them into a table.
The function with Anonymous is incomplete. I make several tests but im somewhere in the middle.
